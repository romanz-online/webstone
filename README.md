Web-based vanilla Hearthstone currently in development.

Run `npm install` and then `npm start` to run the website.

To-do List:

- Get all card images and sound effects. Most are now in the files but some are sporadically missing.

- Implement several screens (menu, game, card collection, etc.).

- Organize the content of public javascript into objects or separate single-use scripts as much as possible.

- Make individual events update the client's game state instead of sending the entire game state each time and having the client reload everything.

- Figure out how to implement Choose One :(

- Do animations...

  - Draw card https://animista.net/play/entrances/slit-in
  - Show what card opponent is playing https://animista.net/play/entrances/tilt-in-fwd/tilt-in-fwd-tr
  - Place minion https://animista.net/play/entrances/puff-in/puff-in-center
